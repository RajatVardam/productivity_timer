## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

The application uses `tkinter`, which is part of the standard Python library, so no external packages are needed to run it from the source.

### Running from Source

Clone this repository or download the source code and run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üì¶ Building an Executable

You can create a standalone executable file using `PyInstaller`.

1.  **Install PyInstaller**:
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Create the Executable**:
    Run the following command in your terminal. This will create a single, windowed executable file named `Productivity Timer.exe` with a custom icon. Make sure you have an icon file named `clock.ico` in the same directory.

    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "Productivity Timer" --icon=clock.ico main.py
    ```
